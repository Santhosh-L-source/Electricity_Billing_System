1. The user enters:
   - Customer name  
   - Previous reading (kWh)  
   - Current reading (kWh)  
   - Fixed charge (₹)
2. When you click **Calculate**, the JavaScript file:
   - Finds units = current − previous  
   - Calculates energy charge using Tamil Nadu electricity rates  
   - Adds the fixed charge  
   - Shows the total amount to pay
3. The **Reset** button clears all inputs.
